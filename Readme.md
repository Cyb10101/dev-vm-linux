A better and faster variant is to use Docker using [docker-global](https://github.com/Cyb10101/docker-global) and [php-dev](https://github.com/Cyb10101/php-dev).

I recommend installing docker directly in Linux, virtually using Virtualbox or in Windows using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

Notes:

* [Docker](https://github.com/Cyb10101/notes/blob/master/Server/Docker)
* [VirtualBox](https://github.com/Cyb10101/notes/blob/master/Software/VirtualBox)
* [WSL - Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://github.com/Cyb10101/notes/tree/master/System/Windows/WSL)

# Development environment as a virtual machine

This tutorial will create a virtual machine that includes Linux with the Ubuntu Desktop distribution.

Why a desktop version? Because it should be as easy as possible for the users.

## Try it

Notes:

* URL and VM can change through development
* Keyboard layout is set to german

## Create a virtual machine

To develop a own virtual machine from scratch see file [create.md](create.md).

## Usage of virtual machine

To import a OVA file and configure the virtual machine see file [usage.md](usage.md).

## I need a desktop!

No you don't... Maybe not recommended. See file [desktop.md](desktop.md)
